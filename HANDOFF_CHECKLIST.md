# HP Estimator — Integration Handoff Checklist

## DONE — 2026-04-24

### GBP OAuth (Google Business Profile)
- [x] Env vars wired in Railway: `GBP_CLIENT_ID`, `GBP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GBP_REDIRECT_URI`
- [x] Redirect URI registered in Google Cloud Console
- [x] Code scaffolded: `server/integrations/gbp/oauth.ts`, `routes.ts`, `server/routers/gbp.ts`
- [x] `gbpTokens` table in schema + migration 0065
- [x] Connect button live at `/admin/settings` → Integrations → Google Business Profile
- **Status:** Awaiting first Connect click from `/admin/settings`. Token will persist in DB after first OAuth.

### Meta (Facebook / Instagram)
- [x] Env vars wired in Railway: `META_APP_ID`, `META_APP_SECRET`, `META_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN`, `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID`
- [x] System-user token pattern (no per-user OAuth flow)
- [x] Code scaffolded: `server/integrations/meta/client.ts`, `routes.ts`, `server/routers/meta.ts`
- [x] `metaConnections` table in schema + migration 0065
- [x] "Verify token" button live at `/admin/settings` → Integrations → Meta
- **Status:** Env wired + code scaffolded. Click "Verify token" in settings to activate and write the first `metaConnections` row.

### Google Ads
- [x] Env vars wired in Railway: `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN`, `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_ADS_CUSTOMER_ID`, `GOOGLE_ADS_REDIRECT_URI`
- [x] Redirect URI registered in Google Cloud Console
- [x] Code scaffolded: `server/integrations/google-ads/oauth.ts`, `client.ts`, `routes.ts`, `server/routers/googleAds.ts`
- [x] `googleAdsTokens` table in schema + migration 0065
- [x] Connect button live at `/admin/settings` → Integrations → Google Ads
- **Status:** Env wired + code scaffolded. Awaiting first Connect click. **Developer token is still in test/pending state** until Google approves the application — API calls will fail with a 403 until approval lands.

### GA4
- [x] Env var wired in Railway: `VITE_GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID`
- [x] gtag.js bootstrap added to `client/index.html` (lazy-loads only when var is set)
- [x] Route-change pageview tracking added to `client/src/App.tsx`
- [x] `trackEvent()` helper exported from `App.tsx` for custom events (lead form submitted, baseline booked, membership tier viewed, estimate downloaded)
- **Status:** Tracking active on next deploy. Wire `trackEvent('lead_form_submitted', {...})` calls at the relevant submit handlers when ready.

### AI Agent Tools
- [x] `aiAgentTools` table added to schema + migration 0065
- [x] Boot-time `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` guard in `server/_core/index.ts`
- [x] `scripts/seed-ai-agents.mjs` seeds 11 tools across GBP, Meta, Google Ads categories
- [x] All tools are `mode: 'draft_only'` — agents draft, humans approve in inbox

---

### Snyk Security Scanning
- [x] `SNYK_TOKEN` added to GitHub Actions secrets for HP-Estimator-app repo
- [x] `.github/workflows/security.yml` added — triggers on PR → main, push to main, weekly Monday 4 AM UTC
- [x] `snyk test --severity-threshold=high` + `snyk monitor` steps wired
- [x] First run uses `continue-on-error: true` to capture baseline findings without blocking the integration PR
- **Status:** Workflow ships with this PR. After first run, triage findings and remove `continue-on-error` to start gating merges on high/critical.

## DEFERRED — skip indefinitely

### Yelp Fusion API
- **Decision:** Deferred indefinitely.
- **Reason:** Post-trial pricing is $229–$643/mo, which blows the lean-tier budget. The affluent ICP (home stewardship advisory) does not use Yelp to find vendors. Google Business Profile (already wired, free) covers the review/discovery surface fully.
- **Optional future swap:** Houzz Pro free listing tier if Marcin wants more review presence beyond GBP.
- **Cleanup:** Yelp removed from any agent tool stubs or scaffolded routes. References remaining in the codebase are limited to lead-source dropdowns (historical data field), which are intentionally preserved for backward compatibility with existing records.

## Rotate after initial wiring

These secrets should be rotated in their respective consoles after the first successful connection is confirmed in production:

| Secret | Console |
|--------|---------|
| `GBP_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs |
| `META_APP_SECRET` | Meta for Developers → App Settings → Basic |
| `META_SYSTEM_USER_TOKEN` | Meta Business Manager → System Users → Generate new token |
| `GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google Cloud Console → Credentials → OAuth 2.0 Client IDs |

---

## Next steps after Google Ads approval

1. Google will email when the developer token is approved (test → production tier).
2. Update `GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN` in Railway with the production token.
3. Click "Connect" in `/admin/settings` → Integrations → Google Ads.
4. Confirm `/api/health` returns `googleAds: { configured: true, connected: true }`.
